*i understand kinematics??*

- v = instantaneous velocity
- a = acceleration (either 9.8 or 0)
- d = distance traveled
- x = x position
- y = y position

when no keys are pressed + floor "collision"
> player has v = 0, a = 0

when w **released**
> player has some set starting velocity (where velocity > 0), a = 9.8

when a or d **pressed**
> player has some set starting velocity (where velocity > 0) and assume no air resistance (no acceleration in x direction)

when s pressed or released
> nothing happens lol 

how to determine position
> x = x + d , y = y + d
